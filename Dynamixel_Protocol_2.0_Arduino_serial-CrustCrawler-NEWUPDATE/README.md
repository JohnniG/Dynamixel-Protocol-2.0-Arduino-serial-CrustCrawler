 How to run it: upload to arduino with the dynamixel_serial library installed in your arduino libraries folder.                       
                After upload, disconnect usb from arduino and add power to CrustCrawler and the arduino board.                        
                The program should start by it self. :)                                                                               
                                                                                                                                      
                PIN Setup:  Green wire to PIN 10,
                            Yellow wire to PIN 11,
                            Black wire to ground,
                            Red wire to 5v,
                            Blue wire to PIN2 
                                                                                                             
                This code was developed in collaboration with several groups, to enable all the groups a good
                base code to start programming the CrustCrawler from. ;)
